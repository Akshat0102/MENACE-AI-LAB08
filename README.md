# MENACE-AI-LAB08

MENACE (the Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine) is a machine learning computer built from 304 matchboxes.
MENACE is a learning algorithm for playing the game of Tic Tac Toe. It uses a form of reinforcement learning to adjust its behavior based on the outcomes of previous games. MENACE can be seen as a primitive form of a reinforcement learning algorithm, since it updates its behavior based on the reward signal obtained through winning or losing a game.
